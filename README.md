# C# Audio Processing Service with ML Interface

## Overview
This project demonstrates a C#-based audio processing service
designed with clean architecture and interface-driven development.
The system is prepared for integration with machine learning SDKs
and designed to be replacement-ready for legacy applications.

## Problem
Legacy backend systems often struggle with maintainability,
performance optimization, and integration with modern technologies
such as machine learning libraries.

## Solution
This project implements a clean and modular C# service that:
- Processes audio metadata
- Extracts structured features
- Persists results into a relational database
- Exposes an interface layer ready for ML integration

## Architecture
- Core: domain models and interfaces
- Infrastructure: database and ML implementation
- Interface-driven design to support future extensions

## Technologies Used
- C# (.NET)
- SQLite
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interface-based design
- Git version control

## Outcome
The system demonstrates how a cleanly structured C# service
can serve as a foundation for audio processing and machine learning
integration in a production-ready environment.
